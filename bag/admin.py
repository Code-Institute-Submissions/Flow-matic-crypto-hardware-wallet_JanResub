"""
The admin module in Django's contrib package provides a web-based
 administration interface for managing the data in a Django project.
This module allows developers to register models with the admin site
 and create custom views and actions for managing the data.
 It also provides a default set of views and actions for working with the data,
 including creating, editing, and deleting records.
The admin site is a powerful tool for managing data in a Django project,
but it should be used with caution. It should be protected by a
secure login system and only given to trusted users.
