 Imports the Django models module, providing a high-level
and abstracted interface
    for creating, manipulating and querying databases in a Django application.

    The models module provides a rich set of tools
    for creating and manipulating
    database tables and their corresponding records, allowing for easy
    integration with Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
    and the ability to
    interact with the database using Python code.
