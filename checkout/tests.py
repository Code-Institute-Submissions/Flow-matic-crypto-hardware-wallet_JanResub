Django's test case class

This class provides a way to test Django's views and models.
It provides several useful methods for creating and
manipulating test data, as well as methods for asserting the
correctness of the results.
It also provides a way to test whether the code throws
exceptions when it's supposed to and whether it doesn't
when it's not supposed to.

Methods:
    setUp() : Method that run before each test method
    tearDown() : Method that run after each test method
    assert* : A series of assertion methods for testing
    the correctness of the results
